> Be sure to answer at least one question in each of the nine sections below. Your responses can be in notes/bullet form. They do not need to be in complete sentences. I encourage you to transcribe quotes from the talk(s) into your notes when they expemplify something that you are noticing about the discourse. These quotes are your "data" in this assignment. 

# 1. Establish the context

## Who is the speaker addressing, and why are they addressing this particular audience?
- millenials/GenZ, younger generation, more provocative, more sensationalized- one thing more than the other

## How receptive do you think the audience will be to the message?

# 4. Assess assumptions 

## What worldviews shape how the speaker approaches communication?
- Positivist- don't need theories- people make theories and people mess it up so focus directly on the data

## Does the speaker communicate from a place of power and privilege or from a place of marginalization?

## Is the speaker confirming a dominant discourse or challenging a dominant discourse?

## How might societal power structures shape what is being said?

---
# 8. Assess how the discourse disseminates
